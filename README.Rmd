## Overview

eflows is a toolbox for predicting the energy flows between the different elements of an energy system, including renewable energies, stationary batteries and electric vehicles. 
In addition, the same functions involved in the simulation can be reused to do real-time steering of the energy system.

## Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("cvmartin/eflows")
