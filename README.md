## Overview

eflows is a toolbox for predicting the energy flows between the
different elements of an energy system, including renewable energies,
stationary batteries and electric vehicles. In addition, the same
functions involved in the simulation can be reused to do real-time
steering of the energy system.

## Installation

``` r
devtools::install_github("cvmartin/eflows")
```

## Showcase

A shiny app showcasing user cases of eflows is deployed
[here](https://cvmartin.shinyapps.io/eflows/).
